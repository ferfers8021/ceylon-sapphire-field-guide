# Module 1: Geological Origins of Sri Lankan Sapphires

## Introduction
Sri Lanka, historically known as Ceylon, is one of the world's oldest and most celebrated sources of fine sapphires. The island's gem‑bearing gravels have yielded sapphires for over 2,000 years, and the geological story behind these treasures is as fascinating as the gems themselves.

## Tectonic Setting & Metamorphic Origins
Ceylon sapphires are **metamorphic** in origin. They formed during high‑grade granulite‑facies metamorphism of aluminium‑rich sedimentary rocks (pelites) within the **Highland Complex** of Sri Lanka, a segment of the ancient Gondwana supercontinent.

- **Age**: The primary metamorphic event occurred during the **Pan‑African orogeny** (~550–600 million years ago).
- **Protolith**: Original rocks were bauxite‑like laterites or clay‑rich sediments that contained sufficient aluminium and trace elements (iron, titanium, chromium) to form corundum (Al₂O₃).
- **Metamorphic Conditions**: Temperatures of 750–850 °C and pressures of 5–7 kbar, creating a stable environment for corundum crystallization.

## Major Sapphire‑Bearing Regions
Sri Lankan sapphires are almost exclusively mined from **alluvial deposits**—gem‑bearing gravels (called “illam”) that have been eroded from primary bedrock and concentrated by rivers over millions of years.

| Region | Key Characteristics |
|--------|----------------------|
| **Ratnapura** (“City of Gems”) | The most prolific area; gravels of the Kalu Ganga and Gin Ganga rivers produce the majority of commercial‑quality sapphires. |
| **Elahera** | Located in the central highlands; known for medium‑ to dark‑blue stones, often with distinctive silk and mineral inclusions. |
| **Balangoda** | Yields sapphires with a slightly greener hue, sometimes referred to as “teal” sapphires. |
| **Rakwana** | Smaller deposits, occasionally producing fancy‑color sapphires (pinks, yellows, padparadscha). |

## Alluvial vs. Primary Deposits
- **Alluvial (secondary) deposits**: The only economically worked sources in Sri Lanka. Sapphires are found in gem‑gravel layers (“illam”) 1–20 m below the surface, mixed with other heavy minerals (zircon, garnet, spinel).
- **Primary (in‑situ) deposits**: The original corundum‑bearing metamorphic rocks are rarely exposed and are not mined directly. Their weathering over geologic time supplied the alluvial gravels.

## Geological Uniqueness of Ceylon Sapphires
1. **Low Iron Content** – Compared to many other sapphire sources (e.g., Australia, Thailand), Ceylon sapphires typically have very low iron concentrations. This results in higher transparency and a purer, more vivid blue (less “steely” or greenish overtone).
2. **Inclusion Suite** – The metamorphic origin produces diagnostic inclusions such as **long, fine rutile needles (“silk”)**, **zircon crystals with pleochroic halos**, and **apatite**, **graphite**, and **calcite** crystals.
3. **Color Zoning** – Many Ceylon sapphires exhibit subtle, angular color zoning related to growth during metamorphic crystallization, often visible under magnification.

## Comparison with Other Global Localities
| Source | Geological Setting | Typical Color | Key Differentiators |
|--------|-------------------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Kashmir** | Pegmatitic, related to granitic intrusions into metamorphosed limestones | Velvety “cornflower” blue | Extremely fine silk, milky appearance, no zircon halos |
| **Madagascar** | Metamorphic (similar to Sri Lanka) but often higher iron | Vivid blue to green‑blue | Higher iron content, different inclusion assemblages (e.g., feldspar, mica) |
| **Australia (New South Wales)** | Volcanic‑related (basalt‑hosted) | Dark inky blue, often with greenish tones | High iron, strong dichroism, lack of silk |
| **Montana (USA)** | Volcanic (alkaline basalt) | Light to medium blue, sometimes metallic‑looking | Hexagonal growth zoning, fingerprint inclusions |

## Practical Implications for Identification
- **Origin Determination**: The combination of low‑iron chemistry, specific inclusion types, and alluvial occurrence strongly points to a Ceylon origin.
- **Field Clues**: When examining rough or cut stones, look for:
    - Rounded, water‑worn surfaces (alluvial abrasion).
    - Presence of zircon crystals with radiation halos.
    - Fine, intersecting rutile silk.
    - Angular, straight‑line color zoning (vs. curved zoning in volcanic sapphires).
