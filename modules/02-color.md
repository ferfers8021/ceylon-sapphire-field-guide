# Module 2: The Spectrum of Ceylon Blue – Color Grading and Terminology

## Introduction
Color is the single most important value factor for sapphires. Ceylon sapphires are renowned for their **vivid, medium‑blue hues** that combine high saturation with excellent transparency. This module explains the language and grading scales used to describe sapphire color, with a focus on the unique palette of Sri Lankan stones.

## The Three Dimensions of Color
Gemological color assessment breaks down into three independent attributes:

1. **Hue** – The dominant spectral color (e.g., blue, violet‑blue, green‑blue).
2. **Tone** – The lightness or darkness of the color (from very light to very dark).
3. **Saturation** – The intensity or purity of the hue (from dull/grayish to vivid/strong).

### Hue
- **Primary Hue**: For sapphires, the ideal is a pure **blue** (neither violet‑blue nor green‑blue).
- **Secondary Hue Modifiers**: Common modifiers in Ceylon sapphires include:
    - **Violetish‑blue** – A slight violet overtone, often seen in stones from Ratnapura.
    - **Greenish‑blue** – More typical of Balangoda and some Elahera material.
    - **Grayish‑blue** – Usually indicates higher iron content or certain types of silk.

### Tone (Lightness)
Tone is graded on a scale from 1 (extremely light) to 10 (extremely dark). The most desirable range for Ceylon blue sapphires is **5–7** (medium to medium‑dark).

- **Too light (tone 2–4)**: May appear washed‑out or “pastel”; often called “sky blue.”
- **Too dark (tone 8–10)**: Can look inky or blackish in indoor light; saturation may be masked.

### Saturation (Intensity)
Saturation describes how much gray or brown masks the pure hue. The GIA scale uses terms such as:
- **Grayish‑blue** / **Brownish‑blue** (low saturation)
- **Blue** (moderate saturation)
- **Vivid Blue** (high saturation)
- **Strong Blue** (very high saturation, sometimes with a slight violet modifier)

Ceylon sapphires typically exhibit **vivid** to **strong** saturation because of their low iron content.

## The “Ceylon Blue” Ideal
The term “Ceylon Blue” in the trade refers to a **medium‑light to medium‑dark, vivid blue with a slight violet undertone**. It is not a precisely defined scientific term, but it evokes the classic, lively blue that has made Sri Lankan sapphires famous.

| Grade | Description | Typical Ceylon Example |
|-------|-------------|------------------------|
| **Exceptional** | Vivid blue, tone 5–6, no noticeable secondary hue | Rare “cornflower” blue stones from Ratnapura |
| **Fine** | Vivid violetish‑blue, tone 6–7, strong saturation | Most high‑quality commercial sapphires |
| **Commercial** | Blue with slight grayish or greenish modifier, tone 5–8, moderate saturation | Common goods from Elahera |
| **Light/Pastel** | Light tone (2–4), lower saturation, often called “sky blue” | Smaller stones, fancy‑color blends |

## Fancy‑Color Sapphires from Sri Lanka
Although blue dominates, Sri Lanka produces a remarkable variety of fancy‑color sapphires:

- **Padparadscha** – A delicate blend of pink and orange, resembling a lotus blossom. The most prized fancy color; true padparadscha is extremely rare.
- **Pink Sapphires** – Range from light pastel pink to intense hot pink; caused by traces of chromium.
- **Yellow Sapphires** – Pale lemon to golden yellow; caused by iron (Fe³⁺) centers.
- **Purple/Violet Sapphires** – Often have a slight blue modifier; popular in smaller sizes.
- **Green Sapphires** – Usually a bluish‑green; rarely pure green.
- **Color‑Change Sapphires** – Some Ceylon sapphires exhibit a subtle change from blue in daylight to violet under incandescent light (weak chromium + vanadium).

## Grading Systems & Trade Language
- **GIA Colored Stone Grading System** – Used in laboratory reports; describes hue, tone, saturation separately.
- **Trade Terms** (sometimes ambiguous):
    - **Royal Blue** – Very saturated, medium‑dark to dark blue with a violet undertone (often used for fine Burmese or Ceylon stones).
    - **Cornflower Blue** – Medium‑light, vivid blue with a soft, velvety appearance (originally describing Kashmir sapphires, now applied to similar Ceylon stones).
    - **Peacock Blue** – A blue with a slight greenish secondary hue, reminiscent of a peacock feather.
    - **Indigo** – Dark, saturated blue with a violet overtone.

## Practical Color Grading Steps
1. **Use Consistent Lighting** – Daylight equivalent (D65) or a calibrated gem‑viewing lamp.
2. **View Against a Neutral Background** – White or neutral gray; avoid colored surfaces.
3. **Look Through the Crown** – Tilt the stone to see the color distribution; note any zoning.
4. **Compare with Master Stones** – If available, use a set of pre‑graded reference sapphires.
5. **Describe Using the Three Dimensions** – Always note hue, tone, and saturation separately.

## Common Pitfalls & Misconceptions
- **Over‑reliance on Trade Names** – “Ceylon Blue” can be misused for any light‑blue sapphire; verify origin with inclusions and chemistry.
- **Lighting Effects** – Sapphires can look darker in dim light and more vivid in bright light; always grade under standardized illumination.
- **Cut Influence** – A deep cut can make a stone look darker; a shallow cut can make it look lighter. Consider the proportion when assessing tone.

## Tools for Color Assessment
- **Gemological Microscope** – Helps identify color zoning and inclusions that affect appearance.
- **Spectrophotometer** – Provides objective color measurement (CIE L*a*b* coordinates).
- **Comparison Sets** – Master stones of known hue/tone/saturation.
- **Color Grading Loupe** – Some loupes have built‑in color filters to isolate hue.

## Summary
Mastering color grading is essential for valuing and identifying Ceylon sapphires. The unique combination of **medium tone**, **high saturation**, and **slight violet modifier** distinguishes the finest Ceylon blues from other sources. Always document color using the three‑dimensional framework (hue, tone, saturation) rather than subjective trade terms alone.
