# Module 4: Treatments and How to Detect Them (e.g., Heat)

## Introduction
The vast majority of sapphires in the market have undergone some form of treatment to improve their color and clarity. Understanding these treatments—and knowing how to detect them—is essential for accurate valuation and ethical trading. This module covers the most common treatments applied to Ceylon sapphires, with a focus on **heat treatment**, and provides practical gemological detection methods.

## Common Treatments for Sapphires

| Treatment | Purpose | Prevalence in Ceylon Sapphires |
|-----------|---------|--------------------------------|
| **Heat Treatment** | Improve color and/or clarity | > 90% of commercial‑quality stones |
| **Diffusion Treatment** | Add surface color (blue, yellow) | Rare for Ceylon; more common for other sources |
| **Beryllium Diffusion** | Create fancy colors (orange, padparadscha) | Occasionally seen |
| **Fracture Filling** | Hide cracks and improve apparent clarity | Uncommon for Ceylon sapphires |
| **Surface Coating** | Temporary color enhancement | Rare, considered unethical |

## 1. Heat Treatment – The “Industry Standard”
Heat treatment is a **permanent, stable** enhancement that has been used for centuries. It involves heating sapphires to temperatures between **1,200 °C and 1,800 °C** in oxidizing or reducing atmospheres.

### Effects of Heat on Ceylon Sapphires
- **Color Improvement**:
    - **Blue stones**: Reduction of greenish or grayish overtone by changing the valence state of iron (Fe²⁺ → Fe³⁺) and dissolving fine silk.
    - **Yellow stones**: Enhancement of yellow color by stabilizing Fe³⁺ centers.
    - **Padparadscha**: May be created or enhanced by careful heat treatment of pale pink‑orange stones.
- **Clarity Improvement**:
    - **Dissolution of silk**: Rutile needles break down and dissolve, reducing the “milky” appearance and making the stone more transparent.
    - **Healing of fractures**: Some fractures may partially heal, reducing their visibility.

### Gemological Evidence of Heat Treatment
Heat treatment leaves subtle but detectable signs. The key is to look for **alteration of inclusions** and **changes in internal features**.

| Feature | Untreated | Heat‑Treated |
|---------|-----------|--------------|
| **Rutile silk** | Intact, intersecting needles | Partially or completely dissolved; may leave “ghost” patterns or short, broken remnants |
| **Zircon halos** | Distinct pleochroic halos | Halos may become diffuse, blurred, or disappear; zircon crystals may show “frosted” surfaces |
| **Fluid inclusions** | Well‑defined, often contain mobile bubbles | May burst or develop “strain halos” around them; sometimes appear as “exploded” or decrepitated |
| **Color zoning** | Sharp, angular zones | Zones may become diffuse, boundaries less distinct |
| **Surface features** | Natural roughness from alluvial wear | May show “pitting” or “heat‑etching” on facet junctions (visible under high magnification) |

## 2. Diffusion Treatment (Surface Diffusion)
Diffusion involves heating the stone in the presence of a color‑bearing chemical (e.g., titanium for blue, iron for yellow) that penetrates only a shallow layer (typically < 0.5 mm).

### Detection Methods
- **Microscope examination**: Color concentrated at facet edges and junctions; “window” effect when viewing through the table.
- **Immersion in methylene iodide**: Reveals a thin colored layer around the periphery.
- **Re‑polishing test**: If a facet is lightly repolished, the diffused color layer is removed, exposing the original lighter core.

## 3. Beryllium Diffusion (Lattice Diffusion)
Beryllium is a small atom that can diffuse deeper into the stone, creating fancy colors (orange, padparadscha‑like hues). Detection is more challenging and often requires advanced spectroscopy.

### Detection Clues
- **Color distribution**: Uneven, blotchy, or concentrated around fractures.
- **Inclusion alteration**: Existing inclusions may show “halos” of altered color.
- **Advanced testing**: LA‑ICP‑MS or LIBS can detect elevated beryllium levels.

## 4. Fracture Filling
Fractures are filled with a glassy substance (often lead‑based) to reduce their visibility. Common in rubies, less so in sapphires.

### Detection Clues
- **Flash effects**: Filled fractures show colorful flash (orange, blue) when tilted under fiber‑optic light.
- **Gas bubbles**: Tiny trapped air bubbles within the filling.
- **Crackled appearance**: “Web‑like” pattern of filled fractures.
- **Lower refractive index**: Filling material has lower RI than corundum, visible with a refractometer near the fracture.

## 5. Surface Coating
A thin layer of colorant (e.g., titanium oxide) is applied to the pavilion to enhance color. This is not permanent and is considered deceptive.

### Detection Clues
- **Abrasion at facet edges**: Coating wears off first at sharp edges, revealing lighter color.
- **Swirl marks**: Uneven application visible under magnification.
- **Tissue‑wipe test**: Color may transfer to a damp cloth (not recommended for valuable stones).

## Step‑by‑Step Detection Workflow
1. **Visual Inspection** – Look for obvious color concentration at facets, uneven color distribution, or surface abrasion.
2. **Microscopy (10×–40×)** – Examine inclusions for signs of alteration (dissolved silk, exploded fluid inclusions, blurred halos).
3. **Immersion** – Use a glass immersion cell with methylene iodide to observe color distribution.
4. **UV Fluorescence** – Heat‑treated sapphires may show altered fluorescence patterns (long‑wave vs. short‑wave).
5. **Advanced Spectroscopy** – If available, use FTIR, UV‑Vis, or LA‑ICP‑MS for definitive evidence.

## Reporting & Disclosure
- **Always disclose** any detected treatment to clients.
- **Use standard terminology** (e.g., “heated,” “diffusion‑treated,” “fracture‑filled”).
- **Refer to laboratory reports** from recognized gemological institutes (GIA, GIT, SSEF, etc.) for high‑value stones.

## Ethical Considerations
- Heat treatment is widely accepted in the trade, provided it is disclosed.
- Diffusion treatments and fracture filling must be clearly disclosed, as they significantly affect value.
- Coating is considered deceptive and should be avoided.

## Summary
Detecting treatments in Ceylon sapphires relies on a systematic examination of inclusions, color distribution, and surface features. **Heat treatment is the norm**, and its signs—such as dissolved silk, altered zircon halos, and exploded fluid inclusions—should be familiar to every gemologist. For more sophisticated treatments (diffusion, beryllium), advanced testing may be required. Always combine multiple observation techniques to reach a confident conclusion.
