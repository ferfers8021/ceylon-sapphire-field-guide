# Module 3: Key Inclusions – Identifying ‘Silk,’ Zircon Halos, and Mineral Crystals

## Introduction
Inclusions are the internal “fingerprints” of a gemstone. For Ceylon sapphires, they provide crucial clues to **origin**, **natural vs. synthetic**, and **treatment history**. This module focuses on the diagnostic inclusion suite characteristic of Sri Lankan sapphires, with practical guidance on what to look for under the microscope.

## The Inclusion Suite of Ceylon Sapphires
Ceylon sapphires typically contain a combination of the following inclusion types, resulting from their metamorphic origin and subsequent alluvial transport:

1. **Rutile needles (“silk”)**
2. **Zircon crystals with pleochroic halos**
3. **Apatite crystals**
4. **Graphite flakes**
5. **Calcite and other carbonate minerals**
6. **Fluid inclusions and healing fractures**
7. **Growth zoning**

## 1. Rutile Needles – “Silk”
Rutile (TiO₂) is the most common mineral inclusion in Sri Lankan sapphires. It occurs as fine, needle‑like crystals that often intersect at **60°/120° angles**, reflecting the hexagonal crystal structure of the host corundum.

### Identification Features
- **Appearance**: Extremely fine, golden‑brown to reddish‑brown needles, often arranged in intersecting bundles.
- **Optic Effect**: When abundant, silk can cause **asterism** (star effect) if oriented correctly. Star sapphires from Sri Lanka usually have distinct, well‑defined rays.
- **Distinction from Other Sources**:
    - **Kashmir silk**: Much finer and denser, giving a “milky” or “sleepy” appearance.
    - **Thai/Cambodian silk**: Often coarser, shorter, and less regularly oriented.

### Practical Tips
- Use **dark‑field illumination** to make silk stand out against a dark background.
- Rotate the stone to see the needles “flash” as they reflect light.
- Silk can be partially dissolved by heat treatment; its presence (especially intact intersecting needles) is a strong indicator of an untreated stone.

## 2. Zircon Crystals with Pleochroic Halos
Zircon (ZrSiO₄) is a common accessory mineral in metamorphic rocks. In Ceylon sapphires, zircon crystals are often surrounded by **pleochroic halos**—dark, circular discolorations caused by radiation damage from tiny amounts of uranium and thorium in the zircon.

### Identification Features
- **Zircon itself**: Small, high‑relief, rounded to euhedral crystals, often transparent and colorless.
- **Halos**: Concentric circles of darker color (brown, yellow, or orange) around the zircon. Under polarized light, the halo may show strong pleochroism (color changes with rotation).
- **Significance**: The presence of zircon with halos is one of the **most diagnostic features** of a Ceylon origin. Few other sapphire sources exhibit this combination.

### Practical Tips
- Use **moderate magnification** (20×–40×) to spot small zircon crystals.
- **Polarizing filters** can enhance the visibility of pleochroic halos.
- Be aware that heat treatment can “heal” or alter halos, making them less distinct.

## 3. Apatite Crystals
Apatite (Ca₅(PO₄)₃(F,Cl,OH)) appears as **hexagonal prismatic crystals**, often colorless or pale green. They are less common than zircon but still a reliable indicator of a metamorphic environment.

### Identification Features
- **Shape**: Hexagonal cross‑sections, sometimes with a dipyramidal termination.
- **Relief**: Moderate relief; may show faint doubling due to apatite’s birefringence.
- **Association**: Often found together with zircon and graphite.

## 4. Graphite Flakes
Graphite (carbon) occurs as **small, opaque, black flakes** or platelets. It is a remnant of organic material in the original sedimentary protolith.

### Identification Features
- **Appearance**: Metallic luster, irregular shapes, often aligned along crystallographic planes.
- **Distinction**: Unlike magnetite or other opaque minerals, graphite is soft and leaves a black streak if touched (not recommended on a cut stone!).

## 5. Calcite and Carbonate Inclusions
Calcite (CaCO₃) and other carbonates appear as **colorless, rhombohedral crystals** or as **fluid‑filled cavities** with a carbonate daughter mineral.

### Identification Features
- **Birefringence**: High interference colors (pinks, blues) under crossed polars.
- **Reaction to Acid**: Will effervesce with weak acid (not a test to perform on a finished gem!).

## 6. Fluid Inclusions and Healing Fractures
Ceylon sapphires often contain **secondary healing fractures** that trap fluids. These “fingerprint” inclusions are irregular, lace‑like patterns that can be mistaken for synthetic flux remnants.

### Identification Features
- **Shape**: Wispy, curved, or feather‑like patterns.
- **Content**: May contain two‑phase (liquid + gas) or three‑phase (liquid + gas + solid) inclusions.
- **Significance**: Indicate natural growth and post‑formation healing; they are less common in synthetic sapphires.

## 7. Growth Zoning
Color zoning in Ceylon sapphires is typically **angular and straight‑lined**, following the crystal faces of the hexagonal prism. This contrasts with the **curved** zoning often seen in volcanic (basalt‑hosted) sapphires.

### Identification Features
- **Appearance**: Alternating bands of lighter and darker blue (or different hues) that form sharp, geometric patterns.
- **Viewing Method**: Use **diffused lighting** and examine the stone perpendicular to the c‑axis.

## Inclusion‑Based Origin Determination
| Inclusion | Ceylon | Kashmir | Madagascar | Australia |
|-----------|--------|---------|------------|-----------|
| **Rutile silk** | Common, fine, intersecting | Very fine, dense, “milky” | Less common, coarser | Rare |
| **Zircon + halos** | **Very characteristic** | Almost never | Occasional, halos rare | Very rare |
| **Apatite** | Common | Rare | Occasional | Rare |
| **Graphite** | Common | Absent | Occasional | Absent |
| **Color zoning** | Angular, straight | Weak or absent | Angular to curved | Curved, hexagonal |

## Practical Microscopy Workflow
1. **Clean the stone** – Remove dust and fingerprints.
2. **Start with low magnification** (10×) to get an overall view.
3. **Switch to dark‑field illumination** to enhance contrast.
4. **Use fiber‑optic light** to highlight specific inclusions.
5. **Rotate and tilt** the stone to see inclusions from different angles.
6. **Switch to polarized light** to check for pleochroic halos and birefringence.
7. **Document** with sketches or photographs.

## Common Pitfalls
- **Misidentifying silk** – Some synthetic sapphires contain fine needle‑like inclusions (e.g., Verneuil‑grown stones); look for intersecting patterns and natural associations.
- **Overlooking halos** – Pleochroic halos can be subtle; always check around small zircon crystals.
- **Confusing healing fractures with flux** – Flux inclusions in synthetic sapphires are often more angular, contain metallic droplets, and lack the fluid‑filled appearance of natural healing fractures.

## Summary
The inclusion suite of Ceylon sapphires is a direct result of their metamorphic history and alluvial secondary deposit. Mastering the recognition of **rutile silk**, **zircon with pleochroic halos**, **apatite**, and **graphite** will allow you to confidently separate Sri Lankan stones from other origins and identify untreated material.
