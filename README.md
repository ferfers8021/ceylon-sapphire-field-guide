# Ceylon Sapphire Interactive Field Guide

## Introduction

Welcome to the Interactive Digital Field Guide for Sri Lankan (Ceylon) Sapphires. This repository serves as a comprehensive training program for gemologists, apprentices, and enthusiasts seeking to master the identification and appreciation of authentic Ceylon sapphires.

As an experienced gemologist specializing in Sri Lankan sapphires, I have created this guide to streamline the training process within our firm and provide a lasting, high-quality resource for future generations of gemologists.

## Purpose & Structure

This guide is structured as a modular, hands‑on curriculum that combines theoretical knowledge with practical application. The repository is organized as follows:

- **`README.md`** – This introduction and guide overview.
- **`modules/`** – Contains the core educational content, divided into focused learning modules.
- **`assessment/`** – Houses a practical case‑study exercise that apprentices must complete and submit for review.
- **GitHub Issues** – Each module is tracked as an issue, allowing for project management and collaborative development.
- **Pull Requests** – Used for submitting and reviewing practical work.

## How to Use This Guide for Training

1. **Start with the Modules**  
   Navigate to the `modules/` directory and study each markdown file in order. These files contain expert knowledge on geological origins, color grading, inclusions, treatments, and more.

2. **Follow the Curriculum Issues**  
   Open the GitHub Issues labeled `curriculum` to see the planned modules and track progress. Each issue describes the topic and can be used for discussion or questions.

3. **Complete the Practical Assessment**  
   A dedicated pull request (titled **"Practical Assessment: Ceylon Sapphire Identification Exercise"**) provides a template for a hands‑on case study. Apprentices should:
   - Fork this repository.
   - Create a new branch for their work.
   - Complete the `assessment/practical-exercise.md` file with their analysis of the five provided sapphire samples.
   - Submit a pull request from their branch to the original repository for mentor review.

4. **Mentor Review**  
   The assessment pull request includes a **"Mentor Review Checklist"** that outlines the criteria used to evaluate the apprentice’s work. Mentors will provide inline comments and approve or request changes based on the checklist.

## Learning Modules

The curriculum is divided into four core modules:

1. **Geological Origins of Sri Lankan Sapphires** – Understanding the formation, mining regions, and geological uniqueness of Ceylon sapphires.
2. **The Spectrum of Ceylon Blue – Color Grading and Terminology** – Mastering hue, tone, saturation, and the industry language for describing blue and fancy‑color sapphires.
3. **Key Inclusions – Identifying 'Silk,' Zircon Halos, and Mineral Crystals** – Learning to recognize diagnostic internal features that confirm origin and natural growth.
4. **Treatments and How to Detect Them (e.g., Heat)** – Differentiating between natural, heated, and other treated stones, and understanding the tools and techniques used for detection.

Each module is available as a markdown file inside `modules/` and is referenced by a corresponding GitHub Issue.
